# Themewatcher

Themewatcher watches a file on the filesystem and updates the browser theme with its contents. This allows dynamic theme updates such as with [Luthien](https://github.com/max-niederman/luthien).

## Installation

*Installation instructions are a work in progress.*

For now, you'll need to clone the repository and run `web-ext build` on the extension, install the extension, then install the native messenger using Cargo and manually editing and copying the manifest file.
